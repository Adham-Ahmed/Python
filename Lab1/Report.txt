1- Python function enumerate()
Show what it does, how it works, and support your answer with an example.

The enumerate function in Python converts a data collection object into an enumerate object. 
Enumerate returns an object that contains a counter 
as a key for each value within an object, making items within the collection easier to access.

snekTuple = ("cobra","viper","snek")
for i in enumerate(snekTuple):
print(i)

2- Lambda expression
#Anonymous function3- Import operator module and explore its functions

The power of lambda is better shown when you use them as an anonymous function inside another function.

Say you have a function definition that takes one argument, and that argument will be multiplied with an unknown number:

def myfunc(n):
  return lambda a : a * n
